#: Scaling the whole channel by 0.001 therefore yields panel voltage before the

#: Regimes the collector has confirmed *with an explicit window*, as
#: (station_id, column, scale, valid_from, valid_to, why).
#:
#: These are the channels whose scale changes partway through the record, which
#: :data:`CONFIRMED` cannot express: it deliberately pins a whole channel, on the
#: collector's word that the unit is constant. For `aisvn` it is not.
#:
#: The collector recompiled the applet on 2020-06-17 and the sheet *re-declares
#: its own header mid-file* to say so. ``IFTTT_aisvn.xlsx`` row 1481 reads
#: 03:18PM with ten columns and ``solar 13964, battery 13814, current 398,
#: temp 336``; row 1482 is a second header row reading
#: ``time, solar, battery, current, power, load, wind, temp, solar2, LiPo``; and
#: row 1483 reads 03:20PM with eleven columns and ``solar 13.61, battery 13.54,
#: current 0.36, temp 31.3``. Five channels step by ~1000x in the same
#: two-minute sample, which is a firmware change and not four coincidences.
#:
#: So for these channels the first stretch is millivolts and everything after is
#: volts, and the boundary is an *instant*:
#:
#:     2020-06-17T08:18:00Z  last millivolt sample  (03:18PM local)
#:     2020-06-17T08:20:00Z  first volt sample      (03:20PM local)
#:
#: The detector had proposed ``valid_to = 2020-06-18T01:48:00Z`` for four of
#: these, which is 17h28m too late: everything after 08:20 was already in volts
#: and would have been scaled a thousand times too small. Confirming a window
#: that is 17 hours wrong is worse than leaving it unconfirmed, because an
#: unconfirmed regime is visibly unconfirmed.
#:
#: `current_a` is here for the same reason (milliamps before, amperes after)
#: even though it has no rollup column, so it changes no published value today;
#: the unit is the collector's statement and belongs recorded next to the others.
